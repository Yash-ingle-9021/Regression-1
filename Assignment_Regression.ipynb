    "print(\"Q_7_ANS :- Polynomial regression is a type of regression analysis that models the relationship between the dependent variable and the independent variable(s) as an nth-degree polynomial. It extends the concept of linear regression by allowing for non-linear relationships between the variables.\\n\\nIn polynomial regression, the model assumes that the dependent variable can be expressed as a polynomial function of the independent variable(s). The polynomial function takes the form:\\n\\nY = θ₀ + θ₁X + θ₂X² + θ₃X³ + ... + θₙXⁿ + ε\\n\\nWhere:\\n- Y represents the dependent variable.\\n- X represents the independent variable.\\n- θ₀, θ₁, θ₂, ..., θₙ are the coefficients or weights associated with each term of the polynomial, representing the impact of each term on the dependent variable.\\n- X², X³, ..., Xⁿ represent the higher-order terms that introduce non-linear relationships between the variables.\\n- ε represents the error term, accounting for the variability in the dependent variable that is not explained by the polynomial function.\\n\\nThe main difference between polynomial regression and linear regression is that polynomial regression can capture non-linear relationships between the variables. In linear regression, the relationship is assumed to be a straight line, while in polynomial regression, the relationship can be curved or have other non-linear shapes.\\n\\nPolynomial regression allows for more flexibility in modeling complex relationships between variables. It can capture phenomena such as quadratic curves, cubic curves, or other higher-order relationships that linear regression cannot represent. By including higher-order terms in the model, polynomial regression can better fit the data and potentially provide more accurate predictions when the relationship between the variables is non-linear.\\n\\nHowever, it's important to note that increasing the degree of the polynomial may lead to overfitting the data, where the model fits the noise or random fluctuations in the data rather than the underlying pattern. Therefore, the degree of the polynomial should be chosen carefully, considering the balance between model complexity and overfitting. \")"
